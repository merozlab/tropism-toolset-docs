## Quick Example

```python
from tropism_toolset import get_angles, fit_Lc, get_gamma, get_beta
import pandas as pd

# Load centerline data
data = pd.read_csv("experiment_centerlines.csv")

# Calculate angles and arclengths
angles = get_angles(data)
arclengths = get_arclengths(data)

# Fit convergence length
x0, Bl, A, Lc, r_squared = fit_Lc(arclengths, angles, show=True)

# Calculate physical constants
gamma = get_gamma(Tc=120, period=15*60)  # Tc in frames, period in seconds
beta = get_beta(Lc, gamma)

print(f"Convergence length: {Lc:.4f} m")
print(f"Gamma: {gamma:.6f} s⁻¹")
print(f"Beta: {beta:.4f} m⁻¹")
```

## What is Tropism Analysis?

Tropisms are directional growth responses of plants to environmental stimuli. This toolkit focuses on:

- **Gravitropism**: Growth response to gravity
- **Proprioception**: Plant's ability to sense its own body curvature
- **Mechanical Properties**: Young's modulus and other material properties
- **Growth Dynamics**: Rates, zones, and temporal patterns

The toolkit processes centerline data extracted from time-lapse images of growing plants, applies mathematical models from plant biomechanics literature, and extracts quantitative parameters characterizing the growth response.
