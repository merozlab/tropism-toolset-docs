This guide presents the mathematical derivation connecting experimentally measurable quantities (tip angle velocity, growth rate, convergence length) to the fundamental gravitropic parameters **β̃** and **γ̃**.

## Overview

The derivation progresses through three key models:
1. **AC Model** ([Bastien et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1214301109)): Curvature dynamics without growth
2. **ACĖ Model** ([Bastien et al. 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2014.00136/full)): Introducing differential growth
3. **Chauvet Approximations** ([Chauvet et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep35431)): Simplifications for slender organs

## Starting Point: AC Model (Bastien et al. 2013)

The AC (Angle-Curvature) model describes gravitropic response dynamics without considering growth:

<Equation>

$$\frac{\partial \kappa}{\partial t} = -\beta \sin\theta - \gamma \kappa$$

</Equation>

**Parameters:**
- **κ**: Curvature (m⁻¹)
- **θ**: Angle from vertical (rad)
- **β**: Gravitropic sensitivity (m⁻¹·s⁻¹)
- **γ**: Proprioceptive sensitivity (s⁻¹)

**Physical Interpretation:**
- The **gravitropic term** (−β sin θ) drives curvature change proportional to inclination
- The **proprioceptive term** (−γ κ) opposes existing curvature through self-sensing

This model successfully describes the steady-state angle profile but cannot account for growth-driven bending.

---

## Introducing Growth: ACĖ Model (Bastien et al. 2014)

Real plant organs grow while bending. Consider differential growth across a stem of radius **R**, with strain rates **ε̇₁** and **ε̇₂** on opposite sides.

### Defining Growth Parameters

The **mean elongation rate**:

<Equation>

$$\dot{E} = \frac{\dot{\varepsilon}_1 + \dot{\varepsilon}_2}{2}$$

</Equation>

The **relative differential growth** (dimensionless):

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\Delta} = \frac{\dot{\varepsilon}_2 - \dot{\varepsilon}_1}{\dot{\varepsilon}_1 + \dot{\varepsilon}_2}$$

</Equation>

**Physical Meaning:**
- Δ̃ = 0: symmetric growth (no bending)
- Δ̃ > 0: faster growth on side 2 (bending toward side 1)
- Δ̃ < 0: faster growth on side 1 (bending toward side 2)

### Material Derivative of Curvature

The curvature evolves due to both local dynamics and advection by growth:

<Equation>

$$\frac{D\kappa}{Dt} = \frac{\partial\kappa}{\partial t} + v_g \frac{\partial\kappa}{\partial s}$$

</Equation>

For differential growth across radius R:

<Equation>

$$\frac{D\kappa}{Dt} \sim \frac{\tilde{\Delta}\, \dot{E}}{R}$$

</Equation>

### Dimensionless Sensitivities

To make the model dimensionless, define rescaled sensitivities:

<Equation>

$$\boxed{\tilde{\beta} = \frac{\beta R}{\dot{E}}, \qquad \tilde{\gamma} = \frac{\gamma}{\dot{E}}}$$

</Equation>

**Why These Definitions?**
- Both β̃ and γ̃ are **dimensionless**
- They represent sensitivity **relative to growth rate**
- β̃ also accounts for organ thickness (radius R)

### ACĖ Growth Equation

Combining the gravitropic/proprioceptive response with growth:

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\Delta} = -\tilde{\beta}\sin\theta - \tilde{\gamma}R\kappa$$

</Equation>

This equation states: **differential growth rate = gravitropic response + proprioceptive response**.

## Approximations for Slender Organs (Chauvet et al. 2016)

For practical measurements on growing plant organs, Chauvet introduced key simplifications.

### Assumption 1: Uniform Curvature in Growth Zone

If the growth zone length is **L_gz** and curvature varies slowly:

<Equation>

$$\frac{\partial\kappa}{\partial s} \approx 0 \quad \text{(uniform curvature)}$$

</Equation>

This means the material derivative simplifies:

<Equation>

$$\frac{D\kappa}{Dt} \approx \frac{\partial\kappa}{\partial t}$$

</Equation>

### Assumption 2: Slender Organ

For thin organs where radius R ≪ Lgz:

<Equation>

$$R\kappa \ll 1 \quad \text{(slender organ approximation)}$$

</Equation>

This allows us to **neglect the proprioceptive term** during the initial bending phase.

### Relating Measurable Quantities

With these approximations, we can express growth rate and curvature in terms of **measurable quantities**:

**Growth rate from total length:**

<Equation>

$$\dot{E} \approx \frac{1}{L_{gz}}\frac{dL}{dt}$$

</Equation>

**Curvature from tip and base angles:**

<Equation>

$$\kappa \approx \frac{\theta_{\text{tip}} - \theta_0}{L_{gz}}$$

</Equation>

### The Chauvet Formula for Δ̃

Substituting these into the growth equation and neglecting the proprioceptive term:

<Equation>

$$\boxed{\tilde{\Delta} = R\,\frac{d\theta_{\text{tip}}/dt}{dL/dt}}$$

</Equation>

**This is the key experimental formula!** It relates the dimensionless differential growth parameter to:
- **R**: Organ radius (measured directly)
- **dθ_tip/dt**: Angular velocity of the tip (from time-lapse imaging)
- **dL/dt**: Elongation rate (from time-lapse imaging)

---

## Extracting β̃: The Sine Law (Chauvet et al. 2016)

At **early times** when curvature is still small (R κ ≈ 0), the proprioceptive term vanishes:

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\Delta} \approx -\tilde{\beta}\sin\theta_{\text{init}}$$

</Equation>

Rearranging:

<Equation>

$$\boxed{\tilde{\beta} = \frac{\tilde{\Delta}}{\sin\theta_{\text{init}}} = \frac{R}{\sin\theta_{\text{init}}} \cdot \frac{d\theta_{\text{tip}}/dt}{dL/dt}}$$

</Equation>

### Experimental Protocol

**Single Initial Angle:**
If you have only one initial inclination θ_init:

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\beta} = \frac{\tilde{\Delta}}{\sin\theta_{\text{init}}}$$

</Equation>

**Multiple Initial Angles (more robust):**
Perform experiments with different initial inclinations and plot Δ̃ vs. sin(θ_init). The slope gives β̃:

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\Delta} = -\tilde{\beta}\sin\theta_{\text{init}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{slope} = -\tilde{\beta}$$

</Equation>

This approach averages out measurement noise and validates the sine law assumption.

## Extracting γ̃: Convergence Length Method (Bastien et al. 2013)

At **steady state** (long times after reorientation), the plant reaches gravitropic equilibrium where:

<Equation>

$$\frac{D\kappa}{Dt} = 0$$

</Equation>

The AC model predicts an **exponential angle profile**:

<Equation>

$$\theta(s) = \theta_0 \, e^{-\frac{\beta}{\gamma}(s - s_0)} = \theta_0 \, e^{-\frac{s - s_0}{L_c}}$$

</Equation>

### Convergence Length L_c

The **convergence length** is defined as:

<Equation>

$$L_c = \frac{\gamma}{\beta}$$

</Equation>

**Physical Meaning:**
- L_c is the spatial scale over which the angle decays
- Larger L_c → gravitropic response extends over larger portion of the organ
- Smaller L_c → gravitropic response is localized near the tip

### Relating L_c to Dimensionless Parameters

From the definitions of β̃ and γ̃:

<Equation>

$$L_c = \frac{\gamma}{\beta} = \frac{\tilde{\gamma}\dot{E}}{\tilde{\beta}\dot{E}/R} = \frac{R\tilde{\gamma}}{\tilde{\beta}}$$

</Equation>

Solving for γ̃:

<Equation>

$$\boxed{\tilde{\gamma} = \frac{L_c \, \tilde{\beta}}{R}}$$

</Equation>

### Experimental Procedure

1. **Identify steady-state frame** (last frame after growth has stabilized)
2. **Convert to arc-length coordinates** (s, θ)
3. **Fit exponential decay** model to extract L_c
4. **Calculate γ̃** using the formula above

---

## Complete Experimental Workflow

### Step 1: Measure Time Series

From time-lapse imaging, extract:
- Centerline coordinates (x, y) at each frame
- Convert to arc length s and angle θ

### Step 2: Calculate Growth Rate

<Equation>

$$\frac{dL}{dt} = \text{slope of } L(t)$$

</Equation>

Fit linear model to length vs. time during active growth phase.

### Step 3: Calculate Angular Velocity

<Equation>

$$\frac{d\theta_{\text{tip}}}{dt} = \text{slope of } \theta_{\text{tip}}(t)$$

</Equation>

Fit piecewise linear or exponential model to tip angle vs. time.

### Step 4: Calculate Δ̃

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\Delta} = R\,\frac{d\theta_{\text{tip}}/dt}{dL/dt}$$

</Equation>

Use measured organ radius R (e.g., R = 0.002 m for 2 mm diameter).

### Step 5: Calculate β̃

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\beta} = \frac{\tilde{\Delta}}{\sin\theta_{\text{init}}}$$

</Equation>

Use the mean angle of the base region in the first frame as θ_init.

### Step 6: Fit Convergence Length

From steady-state frame, fit:

<Equation>

$$\theta(s) = B_\ell + A\left(1 - e^{-(s-s_0)/L_c}\right)$$

</Equation>

This piecewise model accounts for a constant base region before the exponential decay begins.

### Step 7: Calculate γ̃

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\gamma} = \frac{L_c \, \tilde{\beta}}{R}$$

</Equation>

## Dimensional Analysis

Let's verify the dimensions are consistent:

### Original Parameters

|-----------|-------|------------------|
| β | m⁻¹·s⁻¹ | Gravitropic sensitivity |
| γ | s⁻¹ | Proprioceptive sensitivity |
| R | m | Organ radius |
| Ė | s⁻¹ | Strain rate (elongation) |

### Dimensionless Parameters

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\beta} = \frac{\beta R}{\dot{E}} = \frac{[\text{m}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}][\text{m}]}{[\text{s}^{-1}]} = \text{dimensionless} \quad \checkmark$$

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\gamma} = \frac{\gamma}{\dot{E}} = \frac{[\text{s}^{-1}]}{[\text{s}^{-1}]} = \text{dimensionless} \quad \checkmark$$

</Equation>

### Convergence Length

<Equation>

$$L_c = \frac{\gamma}{\beta} = \frac{[\text{s}^{-1}]}{[\text{m}^{-1}\text{s}^{-1}]} = [\text{m}] \quad \checkmark$$

</Equation>

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\gamma} = \frac{L_c \tilde{\beta}}{R} = \frac{[\text{m}][\text{dimensionless}]}{[\text{m}]} = \text{dimensionless} \quad \checkmark$$

</Equation>

## Key Assumptions and Limitations

### Assumptions Required for This Derivation

1. **Uniform curvature in growth zone**: ∂κ/∂s ≈ 0
   - Valid when growth zone is relatively short
   - Breaks down if curvature varies strongly along the organ

2. **Slender organ**: R κ ≪ 1
   - Valid for thin roots/shoots relative to their curvature
   - Allows neglecting proprioception during initial bending

3. **Early-time sine law**: R κ ≈ 0 when extracting β̃
   - Valid during initial reorientation before strong bending
   - May require using only early time points

4. **Steady-state exponential profile**: For extracting L_c
   - Requires plant reaches gravitropic equilibrium
   - Need sufficient time for stabilization

### When These Assumptions Break Down

**Thick organs (large R):**
- R κ no longer ≪ 1
- Proprioceptive term cannot be neglected
- Need full ACĖ model solution

**Short growth zones with strong curvature gradients:**
- ∂κ/∂s not negligible
- Advection term becomes important
- Need spatial resolution of curvature profile

**Transient dynamics:**
- If plant never reaches steady state (e.g., circumnutation)
- Need time-dependent solutions

## Biological Interpretation

### What β̃ Tells Us

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\beta} = \frac{\beta R}{\dot{E}}$$

</Equation>

**High β̃**:
- Strong gravitropic response relative to growth
- Plant responds quickly to inclination
- Typical of strongly gravitropic roots

**Low β̃**:
- Weak gravitropic response relative to growth
- Plant is "growth-dominated"
- May indicate modified gravitropism (e.g., mutants)

### What γ̃ Tells Us

<Equation>

$$\tilde{\gamma} = \frac{\gamma}{\dot{E}}$$

</Equation>

**High γ̃**:
- Strong proprioceptive sensing relative to growth
- Plant strongly resists curvature
- Short convergence length (localized graviresponse)

**Low γ̃**:
- Weak proprioceptive sensing relative to growth
- Plant allows more curvature
- Long convergence length (extended graviresponse)

### The Ratio: Convergence Length

<Equation>

$$L_c = \frac{R\tilde{\gamma}}{\tilde{\beta}}$$

</Equation>

This ratio sets the **spatial scale** of gravitropic control:
- L_c ~ organ length: graviresponse extends over whole organ
- L_c ≪ organ length: graviresponse localized to tip region
