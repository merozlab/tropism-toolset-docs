This guide introduces the key concepts and theoretical foundations that underpin the Tropism Toolset.

## What are Tropisms?

**Tropisms** are directional growth movements of plants in response to environmental stimuli. Unlike nastic movements (non-directional), tropic responses involve differential growth rates on opposite sides of an organ, causing it to bend toward or away from a stimulus.

### Types of Tropisms

- **Gravitropism**: Response to gravity (roots grow down, shoots grow up)
- **Phototropism**: Response to light
- **Thigmotropism**: Response to touch or contact
- **Hydrotropism**: Response to water gradients

This toolkit focuses primarily on gravitropism and the plant's proprioceptive response to its own curvature.

## Key Physical Parameters

### Convergence Length (Lc)

The **convergence length** is a characteristic length scale describing how far along the plant organ the gravitropic response extends.

<Equation>
$$
L_c = \frac{\gamma}{\beta}
$$
</Equation>

- Typical values: 0.01 - 0.1 m for roots
- Extracted by fitting a saturating exponential to angle vs. arclength data
- Represents the spatial extent of the growth zone response

### Proprioceptive Sensitivity (γ)

**Gamma** (γ) quantifies how quickly a plant corrects its curvature. It represents the plant's sensitivity to its own shape (proprioception).

<Equation>
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{T_c \cdot \Delta t}
$$
</Equation>

Where:
- $T_c$ = time to reach steady state (in frames)
- $\Delta t$ = time between frames (in seconds)

- Units: s⁻¹ (inverse seconds)
- Higher γ = faster response to curvature
- Characteristic time: $\tau = 1/\gamma$

### Gravitropic Sensitivity (β)

**Beta** (β) measures the plant's spatial sensitivity to gravitational stimulus.

<Equation>
$$
\beta = \frac{\gamma}{L_c}
$$
</Equation>

- Units: m⁻¹ (inverse meters)
- Relates proprioceptive and spatial responses
- Higher β = stronger gravitropic response per unit length

### Young's Modulus (E)

**Young's modulus** characterizes the material stiffness of the plant tissue.

<Equation>
$$
E = \frac{\text{stress}}{\text{strain}}
$$
</Equation>

- Units: Pa (Pascals)
- Typical range: 1-100 MPa for plant tissues
- Extracted from bending experiments or mechanical models

## Coordinate Systems

### Cartesian Coordinates (x, y)

The raw data from image analysis consists of pixel coordinates:
- **x**: Horizontal position
- **y**: Vertical position
- **frame**: Time point

```python
# Example data structure
   frame    x      y
0      0  245  1088
1      0  246  1076
2      0  248  1064
```

### Arc-Length Coordinates (s, θ)

For analysis, we transform to natural coordinates that follow the centerline:
- **s**: Arc length from the base (cumulative distance along centerline)
- **θ**: Local tangent angle relative to vertical

```python
from tropism_toolset import x_y_to_s_theta

s, theta = x_y_to_s_theta(x_coords, y_coords, px_to_m)
```

This transformation is crucial because gravitropic models are formulated in terms of curvature and angle along the organ.

## Data Requirements

### Centerline Data

Your primary input is a CSV file containing traced centerlines from time-lapse images:

```csv
frame,x,y
0,245.0,1088.0
0,246.2,1076.3
0,248.1,1064.8
...
```

**Requirements:**
- Sequential points ordered from base to tip
- Consistent frame numbering
- Sufficient spatial resolution (recommended: >50 points per organ)

**Data Sources:**
- [SAP (Segmentation App)](https://github.com/merozlab/plant-segmentation-app) - Recommended
- Manual tracing in ImageJ/Fiji
- Custom image processing pipelines

### Mask Data (Optional)

For steady-state detection and growth zone analysis, binary mask images can be used:

```
experiment_masks/
├── 00001_mask.bmp
├── 00002_mask.bmp
├── 00003_mask.bmp
...
```

**Format:**
- Binary BMP images (black background, white organ)
- Sequential numbering with zero-padding
- Same time resolution as centerline data

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Loading

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("centerlines.csv")
```

### 2. Geometric Analysis

Calculate local angles and arc lengths:

```python
from tropism_toolset import get_angles, get_arclengths

angles = get_angles(frame_data)           # θ(s)
arclengths = get_arclengths(frame_data) / px_to_m  # Convert to meters - s
```

### 3. Curve Fitting

Fit mathematical models to extract parameters:

```python
from tropism_toolset import fit_Lc

x0, Bl, A, Lc, r_squared = fit_Lc(arclengths, angles)
```

The fitted model:

<Equation>
$$
\theta(s) = \begin{cases}
B_\ell & s < s_0 \\
B_\ell + A(1 - e^{-(s-s_0)/L_c}) & s \geq s_0
\end{cases}
$$
</Equation>

### 4. Parameter Extraction

Calculate physical constants:

```python
from tropism_toolset import get_gamma, get_beta

gamma = get_gamma(Tc, period)
beta = get_beta(Lc, gamma)
```

## Mathematical Models

The toolkit implements several theoretical frameworks:

### Chauvet Model

Based on the finding that plants sense **inclination**, not force:

<Equation>
$$
\tilde{\Delta} = \tilde{\beta} \sin\theta_0
$$
</Equation>

Where:
- $\tilde{\Delta}$ = relative differential growth
- $\tilde{\beta}$ = gravitropic sensitivity
- $\theta_0$ = inclination angle

**Reference**: Chauvet et al. (2016), *Sci Rep* 6, 35431

### Moulia Model

Combines gravitropism and proprioception in a unified framework with curvature-based sensing.

### Goriely Model

Alternative formulation based on differential geometry and growth tensor analysis.

See the [Mathematical Models](/guides/models/chauvet/) section for detailed implementations.

## Experimental Design Considerations

### Frame Rate

- **Slow dynamics**: 10-30 minutes per frame for roots
- **Fast dynamics**: 1-5 minutes per frame for rapid responses
- **Trade-off**: Longer intervals reduce data size but may miss transient behavior

### Spatial Resolution

- **Minimum**: 30-50 points per organ
- **Recommended**: 80-150 points per organ
- **Considerations**: Higher resolution improves angle calculation but increases noise sensitivity

### Experiment Duration

- Must capture full response including steady state
- Typical duration: 24-72 hours for gravitropic experiments
- Ensure $T_c$ is well-defined before experiment ends

## Units and Conversions

### Pixel to Meter Conversion

All spatial measurements require calibration:

```python
# Example: 100 pixels = 0.01 meters
px_to_m = 100  # pixels per meter

# Or equivalently:
meter_per_px = 0.01 / 100  # meters per pixel
```

### Time Conversions

Frame intervals must be converted to seconds:

```python
minutes_per_frame = 15
period = minutes_per_frame * 60  # seconds
```
